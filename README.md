## Hi, I'm Niko ~

I'm mostly working in the manually managed memory domain using C++ with a focus on computer graphics and multimedia, while also utilizing high-level abstractions in video game development and virtual reality with Unity and Unreal Engine.

My projects include software renderers, hardware-accelerated graphics, video games and virtual reality simulations, video game console emulators, game AI, and computer vision. I also possess creative skills in 3D modeling, animation, digital art, and have a deep understanding of the digital media production pipeline and asset management.
