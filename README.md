<h1> Hello, I'm Niko ~</h1>

<p align="justify">I work in a VR Research Lab at KSU. For work projects I utilize high-level abstractions in video game development and virtual reality with Unity and Unreal Engine. For personal projects I primarily work in the manually managed memory domain using C++ with a focus on computer graphics and multimedia. Some of my projects include software renderers, ray tracers, hardware accelerated graphics, video games, VR simulations, video game console emulators, and computer vision. </p>
